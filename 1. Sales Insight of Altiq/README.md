## Business Problems

With many branches across India, AtliQ Hardware delivers computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. As sales fall short of expectations, the sales director is having difficulty understanding the company's present concerns and performance. When the director requests sales and market updates from regional managers, they tend to sugar-coat the facts and deliver numerous Excel files, adding to the director's irritation. The annoyance is natural, as individuals frequently struggle to understand figures from Excel spreadsheets.

## Solution

As a data analyst, one answer to the sales director's issue at AtliQ hardware would be to use BI dashboards to aid with data visualisation and analysis. The sales director can access a dashboard that aggregates data from numerous sources, such as the company's sales data, market trends, and regional manager reports. The dashboard allows the sales director to quickly assess the status of the business, identify problem areas, and make data-driven choices.
The sales director may avoid depending on Excel files and sugar-coated reports from regional managers, which can lead to misunderstandings and dissatisfaction, by having a clear, visual depiction of the facts.
